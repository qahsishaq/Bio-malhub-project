                            <h1> Quiz App  Project by Ishaq Ishaq Khalid </h1>


 This tech-quiz-evaluation project was made using purely HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was inspired by the computer-based-test offered by some examination bodies and also some IQ test applications that I've used in the past.

 I would like to appreciate the community of Malhub. I learnt a lot from not only the brilliant instructors but also every single person that I met and assisted me.

 Indeed, I had a wonderful and priceless experience learning and working with everyone.

 This is a project to showcase  little, out of a lot, that I acquired  from the Front-end Course offered by this outstanding institution, MALHUB.

                                Let's get down to business!
I watched a couple of YouTube videos, which served has a guide while building this project. The synchronization of Javascript concepts, styling of HTML with CSS, is what this small project is all about. Surely, there must be bugs and a better approach to making a tech-quiz-evaluation app. I hope to get better and better everyday by honing my Front-end skills,
all thanks to Malhub.
